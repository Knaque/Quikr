# Quikr - a simple Python module
### Python development without all the Googling.
Quikr is a lightweight Python module designed to simplify the programming workflow with easily memorable shorthand for many common functions. Less code, less Googling, less syntax checking, more programming.

## How to install:
Since Quikr is in _very_ early development, it is currently not available through `pip`. However, the installation process is still relatively easy:
* Download the `quikr.py` file.
* Place it in the same directory as the file you're calling Quikr from. This is likely your project's root directory.
* Add `import quikr` to your code.
* (Optional) Add an alias, such as `q = quikr`.
* Happy coding!
