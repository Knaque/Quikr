Quikr is a Python module made to simplify the programming workflow with short, easily memorable aliases for many common functions. Less code, less Googling, less syntax checking, more programming.

Quikr is designed to be easily approachable for everyone. However, if it doesn't quite fit your style, feel free to modify it however you like.

## How to install:
Since Quikr is in _very_ early development, it is currently not available through `pip`. However, the installation process is still relatively easy:
* Download the `quikr.py` file.
* Place it in the same directory as the file you're calling Quikr from. This is likely your project's root directory.
* Add `import quikr` to your code.
* (Optional) Add an alias, such as `q = quikr`.
* Happy coding!
