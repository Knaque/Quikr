Quikr is a small Python module designed to simplify the programming workflow by adding short, easy-to-memorize aliases for many common functions.

## How to install:
Since Quikr is in _very_ early development, it is currently not available through `pip`. However, the installation process is still very easy:
* Download the `quikr.py` file.
* Place it in your project's root directory.
* Add `import quikr` to your code.
* (Optional) Add an alias, such as `q = quikr`.
* Happy coding!
